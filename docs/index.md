SystemML is a flexible, scalable machine learning system.
SystemML's distinguishing characteristics are:

  1. **Algorithm customizability via R-like and Python-like languages**.
  2. **Multiple execution modes**, including Spark MLContext, Spark Batch, Hadoop Batch, Standalone, and JMLC.
  3. **Automatic optimization** based on data and cluster characteristics to ensure both efficiency and scalability.

The [SystemML GitHub README](https://github.com/apache/systemml) describes
building, testing, and running SystemML. Please read [Contributing to SystemML](contributing-to-systemml)
to find out how to help make SystemML even better!

To download SystemML, visit the [downloads](http://systemml.apache.org/download) page.

This version of SystemML supports: Java 8+, Scala 2.11+, Python 2.7/3.5+, Hadoop 2.6+, and Spark 2.1+.

## Quick tour of the documentation

* If you are new to SystemML, please refer to the [installation guide](http://systemml.apache.org/install-systemml.html) and try out our [sample notebooks](http://systemml.apache.org/get-started.html#sample-notebook)
* If you want to invoke one of our [pre-implemented algorithms](algorithms-reference):
  * In Python, consider using 
    * the convenient [mllearn API](http://apache.github.io/systemml/python-reference.html#mllearn-api). The usage is described in our [beginner's guide](http://apache.github.io/systemml/beginners-guide-python.html#invoke-systemmls-algorithms)  
    * Or [Spark MLContext](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide) API
  * In Java/Scala, consider using 
    * [Spark MLContext](spark-mlcontext-programming-guide) API for large datasets
    * Or [JMLC](jmlc) API for in-memory scoring
  * Via Command-line, follow the usage section in the [Algorithms Reference](algorithms-reference) 
* If you want to implement a deep neural network, consider
  * Specifying your network in [Keras](https://keras.io/) format and invoking it with [Keras2DML](beginners-guide-keras2dml) API
  * Or specifying your network in [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) format and invoking it with [Caffe2DML](beginners-guide-caffe2dml) API
  * Or using DML-bodied [NN library](https://github.com/apache/systemml/tree/master/scripts/nn). The usage is described in our [sample notebook](https://github.com/apache/systemml/blob/master/samples/jupyter-notebooks/Deep%20Learning%20Image%20Classification.ipynb)
* Since training a deep neural network is often compute-bound, you may want to enable SystemML's
  * [native BLAS](native-backend)
  * Or [GPU backend](gpu)
* If you want to implement a custom machine learning algorithm and you are familiar with:
  * R syntax, consider implementing your algorithm in [DML](dml-language-reference) (recommended)
  * Python syntax, you can implement your algorithm in [PyDML](beginners-guide-to-dml-and-pydml) or using the [matrix class](http://apache.github.io/systemml/python-reference.html#matrix-class)
* If you want to try out SystemML on your laptop, consider
  * using the above mentioned APIs with Apache Spark (recommended). Please refer to our [installation guide](http://systemml.apache.org/install-systemml.html) for instructions on how to setup SystemML on your laptop
  * Or running SystemML in the [standalone mode](standalone-guide) with Java
